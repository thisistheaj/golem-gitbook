# Introduction

Golem is a JavaScript CLI-Tool for creating, testing, and deploying Urbit apps, as well as integrating with decentralized package management registries such as Egyn.

Rather than building additional tools for Urbit, Golem is the mud and the piping â€” providing a minimally opinionated full-stack framework for combining the existing tools for Urbit development as well as integrating new ones.



Installing ans using it looks like:

```bash
npm install -g @archtype-org/golem
golem new my-urbit-project crud && cd $_
golem init
golem build 
```
