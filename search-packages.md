# Search Packages

You can search the registry for a package to verify that it exists by running:
```
golem search @<publisher-name>/<package-name>
```
The search command in the CLI can't perform fuzzy matching by default. Since the registry contract is decentralized, it is included to allow for easy verification of a package's existence without installing it.
